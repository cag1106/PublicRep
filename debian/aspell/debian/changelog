aspell (0.50.5-5) unstable; urgency=low

aspell (0.50.5-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: made libpspell-dev conflict with and replace
    libpspell4 since otherwise it may break upgrades from woody to sarge,
    apparently (Closes: #278166)

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Mon, 25 Oct 2004 09:35:02 -0700

aspell (0.50.5-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Applied a patch from upstream to fix a buffer overflow in the
    word-list-compress utility.  This is a minor security hole, so bumped
    the urgency to medium.
  * debian/rules: Don't pass a version value with "dh_makeshlibs -V".  The
    default is fine.
  * debian/rules: Don't set CC=g++ when running configure.  This was a
    hack to work around an old broken libtool and is no longer necessary.

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Fri, 25 Jun 2004 15:47:48 -0700

aspell (0.50.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * libaspell15 "Replaces: aspell-bg (<= 3.0-1)" due to that package
    erroneously including /usr/share/aspell/cp* files that are the domain
    of libaspell15. (Closes: #233511)

aspell (0.50.4.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    - Integrates fix introduced in 0.50.4-2

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Sat, 15 Nov 2003 23:38:40 -0800

aspell (0.50.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied patch from upstream to fix a bug causing Aspell to drop the
    last character in a word when saving the word to the personal
    dictionary, in some situations.

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Tue,  7 Oct 2003 18:47:04 -0700

aspell (0.50.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - Complain instead of doing nothing or aborting for unimplemented
      functions in Aspell utility, especially 'aspell filter'.
      (Closes: #189759)
    - Aspell API documentation fixes (Closes: #187290)
  * Integrate upstream fixes to #185142 as well as g++ 3.3 fixes.
  * Upstream now uses newer, less broken libtool, so there's no longer a
    need to rerun the autotool chain and include it in the .diff.gz.

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Sat,  4 Oct 2003 10:11:09 -0700

aspell (0.50.3-13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added tetex-extra, gs-common, and psutils to the Build-Depends-Indep
    so that the postscript documents generated actually contain something
    (Closes: #206236)
  * Bumped up standards version to 3.6.1

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Sat, 23 Aug 2003 20:42:10 -0700

aspell (0.50.3-12) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Use "DESTDIR" instead of "prefix" in install target, and
    pass configure --sysconfdir=/etc.  This will properly set the conf-dir
    to /etc instead of /usr/etc.  (Closes: #194480)
  * prog/checker_string.cpp: added an #include <cassert> to fix
    a failure-to-build with g++ 3.3.

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Fri, 23 May 2003 13:16:36 -0700

aspell (0.50.3-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rewrote the aspell.1 manpage to get in sync with upstream's user manual.
  * Corrected an erroneous example in the aspell.1 that incorrectly
    documented use of the "lang" option.  This caused confusion on how to
    use this option.  Also, noted the correct usage in README.Debian.
    (Closes: #182077)  
  * Added a copy of the FDL to reference from the aspell.1 manpage.
  * Added a debian/aspell-doc.copyright that notes the true license (FDL)
    of the aspell documentation.
  * Added libcurses5-dev as alternative to libcurses-dev in build-depends.
  * Added lintian overrides for false positives on spelling errors.

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Thu, 13 Mar 2003 01:49:10 -0800

aspell (0.50.3-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use debian/compat instead of DH_COMPAT=n in debian/rules.

  * Removed .tex, .lyx, .dvi, and dev-html/index.txt from aspell-doc.
  * Produce PostScript documentation in the build-indep target.
  * Added tetex-bin to Build-Depends-Indep.

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Thu, 27 Feb 2003 22:37:07 -0800

aspell (0.50.3-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * libaspell15 now Conflicts/Replaces with all of the old libaspell's to
    ensure they aren't left lying around from old installations.
    (Closes: #179466)
  * Commented out the AC_DISABLE_STATIC macro in configure.ac so that the
    static library is built, as required by Policy 11.2.
  * Updated maintainer email address.

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Wed, 19 Feb 2003 18:05:18 -0800

    belong. (Closes: #179173)

aspell (0.50.3-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bumped up Build-depends to automake1.7, since this is what upstream
    uses.  Modified debian/rules accordingly.
  * Install upstream's changelog.
  * Conflict with aspell-bg (<= 2.0-2.2).
  * Moved pspell-config and its manpage to libpspell-dev.  It had
    inadvertently been moved from libpspell to aspell-bin. (Closes: #178637)
  * Improved the package descriptions.  Thanks Filip Van Raemdonck
    <mechanix@debian.org> for the suggestions. (Closes: #177528)
  * Things to note that were not mentioned in changelog for the 0.33.x to
    0.50.x release:
    - The library sonames changed, so no explicit action was necessary for
      the GCC 3.2 transition.
    - libaspell15 explicitly conflicts with every old aspell-dictionary
      package.  Since the dictionary format changed, libaspell15 is unable
      to coexist with older libaspell libraries as the libraries would not
      be able to share dictionaries (and quiet breakage would occur).

 -- Brian Nelson <nelson@bignachos.com>  Tue, 28 Jan 2003 16:58:30 -0800

aspell (0.50.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a Conflicts with libpspell4c102.

  * Made aspell a meta-package that depends on aspell-bin and an
    dictionary (Closes: #140183)
  * The libpspell_aspell library is obsolete and no longer included in the
    package (Closes: #160453)
