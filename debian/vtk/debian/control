Depends: ${misc:Depends}, doc-base
Suggests: libvtk5-dev, vtk-examples, vtkdata
Section: doc
Description:  VTK class reference documentation
 The Visualization Toolkit (VTK) is an object oriented, high level
 library that allows one to easily write C++ programs, Tcl, Python and
 Java scripts that do 3D visualization.
 .
 This package contains exhaustive HTML documentation for the all the
 documented VTK C++ classes.  The documentation was generated using
 doxygen and some excellent perl scripts from Sebastien Barre et. al.
 Please read the README.docs in /usr/share/doc/vtk-doc/ for details.
 The documentation is available under /usr/share/doc/vtk/html.  

Package: vtk-examples
Architecture: all
Suggests: libvtk5-dev, tcl-vtk, python-vtk, vtk-doc, python, tclsh, libqt4-dev
Section: graphics
Depends: ${misc:Depends}
Description: C++, Tcl and Python example programs/scripts for VTK
 The Visualization Toolkit (VTK) is an object oriented, high level
 library that allows one to easily write C++ programs, Tcl, Python and
 Java scripts that do 3D visualization.
 .
 This package contains examples from the VTK source. To compile
 the C++ examples you will need to install the vtk-dev package as well.
 Some of them require the libqt4-dev package.
 .
 The Python and Tcl examples can be run with the corresponding packages
 (python-vtk, tcl-vtk).

Description: Visualization Toolkit - A high level 3D visualization library
 The Visualization Toolkit (VTK) is an object oriented, high level
 library that allows one to easily write C++ programs, Tcl, Python and
 Java scripts that do 3D visualization.
 .
 VTK enables users to concentrate on their work by providing a large
 number of excellent and feature packed high level functions that do
 visualization.  The library needs OpenGL to render the graphics and
 for Linux machines Mesa is necessary. The terms/copyright can be read
 in /usr/share/doc/vtk/README and README.html.  VTK-Linux-HOWTO has
 information about using vtk, getting documentataion or help and
 instructions on building VTK.
 .
 This package provides the shared libraries needed to run C++ programs
 that use VTK.
 .
 To compile C++ code that uses VTK you have to install libvtk5-dev.
