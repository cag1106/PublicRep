Description: bumblebeed daemon utilities
 Bumblebee daemon is a rewrite of the original
 [Bumblebee](https://github.com/Bumblebee-Project/Bumblebee)
 service, providing an elegant and stable means of managing Optimus
 hybrid graphics chipsets. A primary goal of this project is to not only
 enable use of the discrete GPU for rendering, but also to enable
 smart power management of the dGPU when it's not in use.
