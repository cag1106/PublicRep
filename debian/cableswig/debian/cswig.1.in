[DESCRIPTION]
CableSwig (cswig) is used to create interfaces (i.e. "wrappers") to
interpreted languages such as Tcl and Python. It was created to
produce wrappers for ITK because the toolkit uses C++ structures that
SWIG cannot parse (deeply nested template instantiations). CableSwig
is a combination tool that uses GCC_XML as the c++ parser. The input
files are Cable style input files. The XML produced from the
Cable/GCC_XML input files are then parsed and feed into a modified
version of SWIG. SWIG is a software development tool that connects
programs written in C and C++ with a variety of high-level programming
languages. It is used to generate the language bindings to the target
language. Currently, Tcl and Python are supported.
