Description: Generate wrappers for Python and Tcl from C++ code
 CableSwig is used to create interfaces (i.e. "wrappers") to interpreted
 languages such as Tcl and Python. It was created to produce wrappers for
 ITK because the toolkit uses C++ structures that SWIG cannot parse (deeply
 nested template instantiations). CableSwig is a combination tool that uses
 GCC_XML as the c++ parser. The input files are Cable style input files. The
 XML produced from the Cable/GCC_XML input files are then parsed and feed
 into a modified version of SWIG. SWIG is a software development tool that
 connects programs written in C and C++ with a variety of high-level
 programming languages. It is used to generate the language bindings to the
 target language. Currently, Tcl and Python are supported.
